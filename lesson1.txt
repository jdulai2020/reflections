Seeing the difference between two files helped me to see the bug because it
showed the changes made between each file.

Easy access to previous version could be helpful because it could allow you to
find mistakes in your new file and revert to the old version if you don't want
the new changes.

When you manually do commits, the commits are more logical and changes and
thought process are easier to see.

Git saves multiple files in one commit because it needs the other files to have
the whole thing work.

You can use git log to find all of your commits, the you can use git diff and
write the two different commits down, which then shows the differences between 
the two files.

Version Control will make you more confident to make changes because you can
always revert back to the old version.

This is the code displayed when you create a new repository and do git status
HEAD detached at df03538
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.DS_Store

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
-bash: __git_ps1: command not found
